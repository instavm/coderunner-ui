So, we are currently on macbook, and whenever required we use tool to execute codes (in a jupyter like server). the code is executed in a container (you wouldn't notice but just know this). \
 \
For file access we have mapped /Users/<username>/Work/ctest/chatui/dexter/public/assets to /app/uploads inside the container. So that will help whenever we need a file inside a container to work on it via the execute code tool.\
\
So, a scenario could be that we want to extract 10 seconds of a video inside a mac, then steps would look like: \
\
1. You would use filesystem to copy the video file from any of allowed directories (we have access to these folder in addition to tthe assets one) to the assets folder. and since its mapped to /app/uploads it will automatically can be seen/accessed from inside the container where we will execute the code.\
\
\
2. Once file is there we can use execute command tool to run any code, like ffmpeg etc (which is executed inside a cell in jupyter internally)\
\
3. If you are not sure of username, then you try the list allowed directories tool and you will the paths. \
\
And Continue (send continue flas as true in last message) doing as much tool calls as possible to complete the task (all steps at once) without asking me for confirmation");
